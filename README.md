# Hey there, I'm Greg (He/Him/His) 🙋🏻‍♂

### I'm a Data Scientist/Data Engineer, chasing stories about all the questions I want to answer. I love to dismantle a mess, see how it works, and reshape the parts into something deeply impactful.

## What I'm up to:
<li> 🧩 Enjoying the puzzle of shaping a world of data into a story we'd all love (or need, or both) to hear. Keeping passion at the forefront, and using humor and narrative to keep it accessible. </li>
<li>🔬 Forever honing the basics, but here's the stuff I'm focusing on lately: </li>
<ul>
  <li> 🐍 Python </li>
  <li> 📊 SQL </li>
  <li> 🌥 Cloud Computing and Architecture </li>
  <li> 🏭 Data Warehousing and ETL </li>
  <li> 🤖 Machine Learning, Including Model Creation and Tuning </li>
  <li> 📽 Visualization and Storytelling (the kind that keeps people engaged) </li>
</ul>
<li> 🏆 Always up for collaboration on anything that can help me learn/ignites passion I've either had, or haven't had *yet*. If you bring the ideas, I'll bring the snacks, and we can make something grand.</li>

## Conversation Pieces:
- ❓What advice would you have for the new kid on the professional data science block? What do you wish you had known sooner?
- 💬 Ask me about the dream I have to build a functional scoreboard for my life, as a way to keep myself motivated to grow.  
- Ѱ I have a degree in psychology, and I'm wildly passionate about giving people access to data that can help them improve their lives. We all have a story, but sometimes it's hard even for us to see the details clearly enough to really tell it, but data can help with that.

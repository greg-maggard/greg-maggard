### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**greg-maggard/greg-maggard** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting started in the realm of data science. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the very basics of the data science pipeline, as well as the basics of the most common tools and languages that are used to work within that pipeline.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me hone my skills on any front. I'm completely new to the space, so any practice is good practice. 
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with general orientation and advice on how to get started. If you have any ideas or lessons to share, I'm all ears and more than happy to learn from you. 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about the dream I have to learn enough that I can build a lifestyle scoreboard for myself.
